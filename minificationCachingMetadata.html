      <h1>Minification</h1>
    <h4>
      Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant
      data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g.
      code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable
      and function names, and so on
    </h4>
    <li>To minify HTML, try HTMLMinifier</li>
    <li>To minify CSS, try CSSNano and csso.</li>

    <li>
      To minify JavaScript, try UglifyJS. The Closure Compiler is also very
      effective. You can create a build process that uses these tools to minify
      and rename the development files and save them to a production directory.

    <h1>Cahing</h1>
    <p>a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data’s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data</p>

    <h2>How does Caching works</h2>
    <p>The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM (Random-access memory) and may also be used in correlation with a software component. A cache's primary purpose is to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying slower storage layer. </p>

    <p>Trading off capacity for speed, a cache typically stores a subset of data transiently, in contrast to databases whose data is usually complete and durable.</p>
    
    <h4>Heavy traffic to a website can result in performance problems, slower page speed, and fewer conversions.

        Dynamic vs. Static Content
        For sites with static page content — i.e., not personalized in any way — page caching creates no problems. But for sites
        with dynamic content that changes among users, caching HTML content could create errors.
        
        For example, a visitor that adds products to his shopping cart changes the content on all pages to show the number of
        items in the cart. If an ecommerce merchant cached the pages of this user, other users would see an inaccurate number of
        items in their cart. This concept applies to any type of personalization.
        
        There are at least two solutions to the problem.
        
       <li> Implement web page personalization in separate JavaScript files and don’t cache them, or cache them for a short period.</li>
       <li> Cache HTML only for anonymous users — users that are not logged in or haven’t added any products to their cart.</li>

    <h1>Metadata</h1>
    <h4>The
    <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
    
    <meta> tags always go inside the
    
    <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and
        viewport settings.
    
        Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
    
        Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web
        services.
    
        There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page),
        through the
        <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).</h4>
